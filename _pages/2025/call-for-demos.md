# Call for Demos:

### Speech Translation, Speech Synthesis, Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Context-aware Speech Processing at IWSLT 2025

Welcome to the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) 2025! This year, IWSLT expands its scope to include demonstrations of state-of-the art cross-lingual communications systems and innovative components that support it.  We seek to show systems that highlight cutting edge research in Speech Translation, Speech Synthesis, Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Context-aware Speech Processing through an engaging Demo Session.

We invite researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals to showcase innovative systems, tools, and technologies that advance the field of speech translation, speech synthesis, TTS and context-aware speech processing. This session provides a platform for interactive demonstrations, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among participants.


### Topics of Interest

Submissions are encouraged in, but not limited to, the following areas:
- Simultaneous Speech-to-Text Translation (English-to-X)
- Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation (English-to-X)
- Context-aware Speech-to-Text Translation
- Multilingual Simultaneous Speech Translation
- Low resource Speech Translation
- Adaptive Segmentation Strategies for Simultaneous Speech Translation
- Model Compression Techniques for Qwen2-Audio
- Advances in neural TTS systems
