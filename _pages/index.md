The International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) is a yearly scientific conference, associated with an open evaluation campaign on spoken language translation, where both scientific papers and system descriptions are presented.  
We are associated with [**SIGSLT**](/sigslt), the ACL-ISCA *Special Interest Group on Spoken Language Translation.* 

**Save the date: the [18th edition of IWSLT](/2021) will take place in Bangkok, Thailand on 5-6 August 2021!**
