## 5-6 Aug. 2021 – ACL-IJCNLP 2021

Welcome to IWSLT!

The International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) is the premier annual scientific conference, dedicated to all aspects of spoken language translation.
For 18 years running, the conference has published and organized key evaluation campaigns in the field, including the creation of requisite data suites, benchmarks, metrics and key tasks that define progress in the field. 
This year's challenges address simultaneous translation, consecutive translation and subtitling tasks, for real-time, low latency as well offline archival purposes and under low-resource, multilingual, and multimodal constraints. 
Scientific papers and system descriptions documenting the state-of-the art achieved by participating teams and contributing
key algorithmic advances are presented at the conference. 

IWSLT is the annual meeting for the SIGSLT's (Special Interest Group on Spoken Language Translation) of ACL, ISCA and ELRA.

IWSLT 2021 will be collocated with [ACL-IJCNLP 2021](https://2021.aclweb.org/){:target="_blank"} in Bangkok, Thailand


## Program

Information about keynote speakers and the conference program will be made available nearer to IWSLT 2021.


## Shared Tasks

The **IWSLT 2021 Evaluation Campaign** will host four shared tasks featuring the following focus areas:

- [Simultaneous Speech Translation](/2021/simultaneous) (Chairs: Juan Pino, Facebook; Katsuhito Sudoh, NAIST)
- [Offline Speech Translation](/2021/offline)  (Chair: Marco Turchi, FBK)
- [Multilingual Speech Translation](/2021/multilingual) (Chair: Elizabeth Salesky, JHU)
- [Low-Resource Speech Translation](/2021/low-resource) (Chair: Antonis Anastasopoulos, George Mason University)

Data, metrics, and evaluation will be provided by the conference organizers.

All tasks will follow the same [important dates](#important-dates). 


### Registration

Registration for 2021 Evaluation Campaign is now open: [Registration Form](https://forms.gle/PSCgFW27fZY2JLW2A){:target="_blank"}.

## Workshop Proposals
Please submit proposals of workshops to the [IWSLT organizers](mailto:iwslt-organizers@googlegroups.com){:target="_blank"}. Proposals should indicate the topic of the workshop and its format. 
Each workshop will be run as distinct session of maximum 2 hours. Please do also provide information about the organizers and potential speakers. 
The workshop topics should be within the scope of the SIGSLT. We are open to any format, e.g. panel, talks, posters, etc. Eventual publication of 
workshop papers in the IWSLT proceedings will go through the regular submission channel for scientific papers (see next item). 

## Paper Submission

Submissions should be scientific papers or shared task system description papers. 
All papers may consist of 4 to 8 pages of content with additional pages of references, formatted using the [ACL-IJCNLP 2021 stylesheets](https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/papers/#paper-submission-and-templates){:target="_blank"}. 
Upon acceptance, all papers will be given one (1) additional content page to address reviewers' comments.
All papers should be submitted via [softconf](){:target="_blank"} (*submission link to come soon*).
Accepted papers will be published in the ACL-IJCNLP 2021 proceedings and will be presented at the IWSLT conference either orally or as a poster.

**Note:**
- Scientific papers must be anonymized for submission, while system description papers do not need to be.
- We accept submissions which have previously been made available as technical reports or preprints, e.g. on arXiv.
- We will not accept scientific papers for publication that overlap significantly in content or results with papers published elsewhere.
- Scientific papers which have been, or plan to be, submitted to other venues must be declared as such at the time of submission, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted and published at IWSLT 2021.
