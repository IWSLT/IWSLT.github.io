Participation requires registration to the [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/) workshops.  

<!--Please register for the Evaluation Campaign via the [registration form](https://forms.gle/pkjTz5oYfae2Csj7A). -->

## Special Session

IWSLT 2024 will include a special session entitled [Recent Highlights in SLT](/2024/special-session)
<!--The session intends to provide an overview of recent highlights from the field across venues, with a series of short presentations focused reviews on recent developments and new/emerging trends. 
Additionally, a short and lively discussion may follow the presentations. 
We believe this initiative will contribute to a better understanding of the current landscape of SLT research and foster collaboration and exchange of ideas within the IWSLT community.
For more information, see here: [Special Session: Recent Highlights in SLT](/2024/special-session). -->
