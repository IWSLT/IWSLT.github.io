## Special Session

IWSLT 2024 will include a special session entitled [Recent Highlights in SLT](/2024/special-session)
<!--The session intends to provide an overview of recent highlights from the field across venues, with a series of short presentations focused reviews on recent developments and new/emerging trends.
