##  12-17 August 2024 - Bangkok

The International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) is an annual scientific conference, associated with an open evaluation campaign on spoken language translation, where both scientific papers and system descriptions are presented.

The 21st edition of IWSLT will be run as an ELRA/ACL event and co-located with [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/){:target="_blank"} in Bangkok, Thailand on  12-17 August 2024. It will be run as a hybrid event.

**Note:**
- Scientific papers must be anonymized for submission, while system description papers do not need to be.
- We accept submissions which have previously been made available as technical reports or preprints, e.g. on arXiv.
- We will not accept scientific papers for publication that overlap significantly in content or results with papers published elsewhere.
- Scientific papers which have been, or plan to be, submitted to other venues must be declared as such at the time of submission, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted and published at IWSLT 2024.
- Scientific papers whose first author is a student will be eligible for the IWSLT 2024 Best Student Paper Award (authors should note eligibility in the paper submission form).
- Limitations and Ethics Statement sections (see [the ACL'23 call for papers for more details](https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/main_conference/)) are encouraged but not required. If included, they should be placed after the conclusion for submission and will not count against the page limit.
