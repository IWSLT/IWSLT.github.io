- Submissions should be scientific papers or evaluation campaign system description papers. 
- All papers may consist of 4 to 8 pages of content with additional pages of references, formatted using the [ACL stylesheets](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html){:target="_blank"}. 
- Upon acceptance, all papers will be given one (1) additional content page to address reviewers' comments. 
- Accepted papers will be published in the ACL Anthology and will be presented at the IWSLT conference either orally or as a poster.
- Scientific papers must be anonymized for submission, while system description papers do not need to be.
- We accept submissions which have previously been made available as technical reports or preprints, e.g. on arXiv.
- We will not accept scientific papers for publication that overlap significantly in content or results with papers published elsewhere.
- Scientific papers which have been, or plan to be, submitted to other venues must be declared as such at the time of submission, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted and published at IWSLT 2024.
- Scientific papers whose first author is a student will be eligible for the IWSLT 2024 Best Student Paper Award (authors should note eligibility in the paper submission form).
- Limitations and Ethics Statement sections (see [the ACL'23 call for papers for more details](https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/main_conference/)) are encouraged but not required. If included, they should be placed after the conclusion for submission and will not count against the page limit.
