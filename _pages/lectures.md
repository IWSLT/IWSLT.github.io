## Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation with Transformer-based Incremental ASR, MT, and TTS
Katsuhito Sudoh Ph.D., Associate Professor at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan

<i class="fas fa-calendar-day"></i> Tue 1 March 2022, 8:00 UTC [(5pm JST / 9am CET / 12am PCT)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20220301T080000&p1=1440&p2=248&p3=5805&p4=224)

**Abstract:**  
Iâ€™ll talk about our English-to-Japanese simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system. It has three Transformer-based incremental processing modules for S2ST: automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). We also evaluated its system-level latency in addition to the module-level latency and accuracy.
