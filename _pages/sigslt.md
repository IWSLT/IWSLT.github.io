  - organize challenges and evaluation campaigns;
  - sponsor and organize the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), meetings, satellites, and tutorial workshops in spoken language translation, operating within the framework of ACL's, ISCA's and ELRA's guidelines for SIGs;
  - make available open source code and data resources, best practices and tools, and evaluation metrics relevant to spoken language translation.
