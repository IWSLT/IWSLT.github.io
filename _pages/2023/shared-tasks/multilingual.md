## Description

At ACL 2022, an ambitious year-long [60-60 D&I Initiative](https://www.2022.aclweb.org/dispecialinitiative){:target="_blank"} was announced, targeting text and speech translation of the ACL Anthology and past recorded talks. Results of this ongoing effort will be shared with the community at ACL 2023. Fittingly, as IWSLT 2023 will be co-located with ACL 2023, this track is a multilingual speech translation shared task on a subset of this data to involve the larger community and the IWSLT community in this effort and spur conversations about related methodology and progress at IWSLT. 

More specific task details will be posted in January.

## Languages

This task will cover ten language pairs, with English as the source and ten 60-60 languages as target languages. 
With this number of target languages, participants are encouraged to pursue multilingual modeling and submit results to all pairs (as opposed to models for individual language pairs). 

* **Source language:** English
* **Target languages (10):** Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Japanese, Persian, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish
  * These language pairs are included in publicly available corpora (e.g. MuST-C)

## Data 

* Training data will include publicly available corpora and pretrained models. In addition, terminology lists and translated abstracts will be provided to adapt to the domain. 
  * The source language and allowed training data will be shared with the other talk translation tasks, which we hope will encourage joint submissions and enable analysis comparing methods across tracks. 
* Evaluation data (development and test sets) will be oral presentations from past ACL talks from the Anthology, with human translations

Training and development data will be released in January.
